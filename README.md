## Arduino code for self training primate chair


This project aim to create an automatic version of the classical primate self-training.

The chair is composed by:

- 3 pushbutton (which the monkey can push to receive the reward)

- a proximity sensor, to let the monkey familiarize with the chair. If activated, this sensor control the position of the animal, giving      him reward were under a certain proximity threshold

- a DC-motor-controlled back door, to close the monkey in the chair when she agree with it.

- a DIY syringe pump for reward delivery

- buttons, switchs and rotatory encoders for the initial setting of the experimental variables.


All the system is organized to ensure a high environmental control to the animal - and, therefore, to ensure animal wellness.
